# FEniCS-GMSH Automation for Factor of Safety (FOS) Calculation

This project automates the process of calculating the **Factor of Safety (FOS)** for a 3D geometry defined in a STEP file. It uses **GMSH** for mesh generation and **FEniCS** for finite element analysis (FEA). The workflow is encapsulated in a single Python function, making it easy to use and integrate into larger workflows.

## Overview

The project consists of two Python functions, `create_two_plate_assembly`, which builds a STEP file of two overlapping plates with holes and can be customized to different plate and hole dimensions. This STEP file along with material properties as input to `calculate_fos` function which returns the Factor of Safety (FOS) along with stress and displacement plots. The functions performs the following steps:

1. **Parametric 3D Model Generation**: Uses build123d to generate a 3D model from parametric data.
2. **Mesh Generation**: Uses GMSH to generate a 3D mesh from the STEP file.
3. **Mesh Conversion**: Converts the GMSH mesh into XDMF format for use in FEniCS.
4. **Finite Element Analysis**: Solves the mechanical problem using FEniCS to compute stresses and diplacements.
5. **FOS Calculation**: Computes the von Mises stress and calculates the Factor of Safety (FOS) based on the yield stress.
